I recommend that you read The <b class="one">Alchemist</b><br>

<b class="two">Listen</b> to your teachers, but cheat in calculus<br>

Tell the <b class="three">truth</b>, regardless of the consequence<br>

And every day, give your momma a compliment<br>

Take your girl to the prom<br>
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo<br>
Slow dance with your woman in your arms<br>
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe<br>
Don't wake your mom up, do yoga, learn 'bout karma<br>
Find God, but leave the dogma<br>
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless<br>
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less<br>
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac<br>
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop<br>
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid<br>
Jaywalk, but look before you do it<br>
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help<br>
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends till it melts<br>
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance<br>
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance<br>
Take risks, cause life moves so fast<br>
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
