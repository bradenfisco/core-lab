I recommend that you read The <b class="one">Alchemist</b><br>

<b class="two">Listen</b> to your teachers, but cheat in calculus<br>

Tell the <b class="three">truth</b>, regardless of the consequence<br>

And every day, give your momma a <b class="four">compliment</b><br>

Take your girl to the <b class="five">prom</b><br>
But don't get too <b class="six">drunk</b> hanging out the limo<br>
Slow <b class="seven">dance</b> with your woman in your arms<br>
Sneak her in after but boy, you better <b class="eight">tiptoe</b><br>
Don't wake your mom up, do yoga, learn 'bout <b class="nine">karma</b><br>
Find <b class="ten">God</b>, but leave the dogma<br>
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be <b class="eleven">selfess</b><br>
Ask more <b class="twelve">questions</b>, talk about yourself less<br>
<b class="thirteen">Study</b> David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac<br>
<b class="fourteen">Watch</b> the sun set with best friends from a rooftop<br>
Wear a helmet, don't be <b class="fifteen">stupid</b><br>
<b class="sixteen">Jaywalk</b>, but look before you do it<br>
If it snows, go outside, <b class="seventeen">build</b> a jump, get some help<br>
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your <b class="eighteen">friends</b> till it melts<br>
Go to festivals, camp, fall in <b class="nineteen">love</b> and dance<br>
Take <b class="twenty">risks</b>, cause life moves so fast<br>
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your <b class="twentyone">chance</b>
