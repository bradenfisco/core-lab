            Gramercy Park is the name of both a small, fenced-in private park and the surrounding neighborhood
            that is referred to also as Gramercy, in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The approximately
            2-acre park, located in the Gramercy Park Historic District, is one of two private parks in New York
            City – the other is Sunnyside Gardens Park in Queens– as well as one of only three in the state only
            people residing around the park who pay an annual fee have a key, and the public is not generally
            allowed in – although the sidewalks of the streets around the park are a popular jogging, strolling,
            and dog-walking route. The neighborhood is mostly located within Manhattan Community District 6 with
            a small portion in Community District 5 It is generally perceived to be a quiet and safe area. The
            neighborhood associated historic district, and park have generally received positive reviews.
            Calling it "a Victorian gentleman who has refused to die", Charlotte Devree in The New York Times
            said that "There is nothing else quite like Gramercy Park in the country."  When the New York City
            Landmarks Preservation Commission created the Gramercy Park Historic District in 1966, they quoted
            from John B. Pine's 1921 book, The Story of Gramercy Park:<br><br><br>

            
            “The laying out of Gramercy Park represents one of the earliest attempts in this country at 'City 
            Planning'. ... As a park given to the prospective owners of the land surrounding it and held in 
            trust for those who made their homes around it, Gramercy Park is unique in this City, and perhaps 
            in this country, and represents the only neighborhood, with possibly one exception, which has remained 
            comparatively unchanged for eighty years — the Park is one of the City's Landmarks”

            The area which is now Gramercy Park was once in the middle of a swamp. 
            In 1831 Samuel B. Ruggles, a developer and advocate of open space, proposed 
            the idea for the park due to the northward growth of Manhattan. He bought the 
            property,  22 acres of what was then a farm called "Gramercy Farm", from the 
            heirs of James Duane, son of the former mayor, father of James Chatham Duane, 
            and a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant. Ruggles then deeded the land on December 
            17, 1832 to five trustees, who pledge to hold 42 lots in trust to be used as 
            parkland. To develop the property, Ruggles spent $180,000 to landscape it, 
            draining the swamp and causing about a million horse cart loads of earth to 
            be moved. He then laid out "Gramercy Square", deeding possession of the square 
            to the owners of the 66 parcels of land he had plotted to surround it, and 
            sought tax-exempt status for the park, which the city's Board of Aldermen 
            granted in 1832. It was the second private square created in the city, after 
            Hudson Square, also known as St. John's Park, which was laid out by the parish 
            of Trinity Church. Numbering of the lots began at #1 on the northwest corner, 
            on Gramercy Park West, and continued counter-clockwise: south down Gramercy 
            Park West, then west to east along Gramercy Park South, north up Gramercy 
            Park East, and finally east to west along Gramercy Park North. <br><br>
            As part of his overall plan for the square, Ruggles received permission on January 28, 
            1833 from the Board of Alderman to open up Fourth Avenue, which had been limited to use 
            by trains, to vehicular traffic.  He also brought about the creation by the state 
            legislature of Lexington Avenue and Irving Place, two new north-south roads laid out 
            between Third and Fourth Avenues and feeding into his development at the top and bottom 
            of the park.  The new streets reduced the number of lots around the park from 66 to 60. 
            <br><br>
            Some of the original townhouses surrounding the park, these at #1 through #4 Gramercy 
            Park were built between 1844 and 1850
            Gramercy Park was enclosed by a fence in 1833, but construction on the surrounding 
            lots did not begin until the 1840s, due to the Panic of 1837. In one regard this was 
            fortunate, since the opening of the Croton Aqueduct in 1842 allowed new townhouses to 
            be constructed with indoor plumbing. 
            <br><br>
            The first formal meeting of the park's trustees took place in 1844 at 17 Union Square, 
            the mansion of James W. Gerard, which is no longer extant, having been 
            demolished in 1938.  By that time, landscaping had already begun with the hiring 
            of James Virtue in 1838, who planted privet inside the fence as a border; by 1839 
            pathways had been laid out and trees and shrubs planted.  Major planting also took
            place in 1844  – the same year the park's gates were first locked – followed by 
            additional landscaping by Brinley & Holbrook in 1916. These plantings had the 
            effect of softening the parks' prim formal design.
